Clothes are rather hard to do because we can't change the mesh of the model. Every clothes model in VRoid its own model.
Sometimes it can work, other times, it won't.

My recommendation is to have a set of model for every type of clothes, with texture variants like what I set up here.




For hair it's even more complicated
